                    <p>Ghosty has become rich in his previous adventures in Princess' castle (<a>CastleHunt</a>) and
                        ancient tombs (<a>Anxys</a>).
                        And as he wanted to enjoy the fruits of his greed in peace, the greedy wizard appeared. YOU!</p>

                    <p>Your goal is to steal Ghosty's treasure and avoid his nasty friends. As you are a wizard, you can
                        spit
                        green
                        pools of acid to confuse and delay monsters, but doing so costs energy. Running around in
                        frantic panic
                        also
                        costs energy, so take care. Study your enemy carefully, they are not the same. Some are smarter
                        than
                        others
                        ... but they are bound to their rules.</p>

                                <p> GhostRun is a clone of <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Radar_Rat_Race"
                                        target="_blank">Radar Rat Race</a>, released in 1982 for Commodore VIC-20 and
                                    C64.
                                    It
                                    was
                                    the very first game I every played on my C64. It was hard and frantic and I
                                    kind of hated it. </p>
                                <p>In this clone I wanted to keep most of the features of the original intact. The main
                                    goal
                                    was
                                    to
                                    design a distinct personalities for antagonists.</p>
                                <p>Source of graphics are various free resource sites. No copyrighted images were

                                    the making of the game. Code is written in JavaScript using JQuery framework.</p>
                                <p>Version II is mostly the same as Version I. Main changes are under the hood. It runs
                                    much
                                    faster
                                    on completely reworked ENGINE and GRID. All mazes generated are now random. The game
                                    has
                                    no
                                    ending, levels above 10 are similar to difficulty but are no harder than 10.</p>
